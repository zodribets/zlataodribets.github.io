My name is Zlata Odribets, and I'm a second-year PhD student in the Department of Linguistics 
at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/linguistics/), 
currently supervised by [James Crippen](https://mull-lab.org/james-a-crippen/) 
and [Martina MartinoviÄ‡](https://inamartinovic.com/). 
I am broadly interested in syntax, semantics, linguistic fieldwork, and language documentation.

Before arriving at McGill, I graduated on top of my class from the BA (Hons.) program 
at the [University of Manitoba](https://umanitoba.ca/arts/linguistics), 
where I majored in linguistics and English literature. During my undergraduate degree, 
I worked on projects in linguistics under the supervision 
of [Will Oxford](https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~oxfordwr/).

My specific research interests lie in **grammatical Voice**, **argument structure**, and **indefiniteness**. I am particularly interested in languages that employ the same morphology for both passivization and antipassivization. I'm currently working on **Tlingit**, a language in the Na-Dene language family, spoken in British Columbia and the Yukon (Canada) and Alaska (USA), and **Ukrainian**, an East Slavic language, primarily spoken in Ukraine, which also happens to be my L1. I have also worked on **Oji-Cree** (Ojibwe), which is part of the Algonquian language family, and **Ilocano**, a Philippine language.

I am originally from Kyiv, Ukraine, where I spent the first 16 years of my life, and I try to visit my hometown at least once a year. I also really love going to new places: at 20 countries (and counting)! As a passionate syntactician, I have a tree diagram tattoo on my collarbone. When I'm not working, I'm either exploring Montreal, doing a puzzle, or curled up with a book somewhere.
